[00:14.59] I want to be right where you are
[00:21.69] I want to be right where you are
[00:37.69] 
[00:29.19] There's no beauty without ends
[00:36.32] No creation with no mends
[00:43.83] A new silent wish, will cast aside our pain
[00:48.58] Distancing side by side in vain
[01:04.08] 
[00:56.95] Reflecting no more anguish by your side
[01:00.44] A contradiction worthy to abide
[01:04.10] Remnants of us ebb and flow
[01:07.09] A glimpse of love just waiting
[01:22.09] 
[01:11.03] Oh, a never-ending hope to mend it all
[01:18.18] Flow, let our time remain and wait for voids to fall
[01:44.18] 
[01:25.05] Ascending through the motions
[01:28.12] It would seem as though they'd last
[01:31.91] Admitting to our questions
[01:35.72] And doubts thrown at the past
[01:50.22] 
[01:40.69] There's no rightness in pretend
[01:47.57] Finding comfort once again
[01:54.85] Wish the days would pass, just yearning for our fate
[01:59.94] Yet there is solace to be found within dismay
[02:22.44] 
[02:08.01] Disowning feelings of grief through these tides
[02:11.65] A complicated love I'd dare not hide
[02:15.30] Turbulences come and go
[02:18.18] But won't reject me whole
[02:30.68] 
[02:22.17] Oh, a bittersweet vision through me that befalls
[02:28.98] Know that despite our voids I swear to hold it all
[02:53.98] 
[02:36.04] While sinking through this ocean
[02:39.28] I would wonder why you'd ask
[02:43.12] Accepting our affection
[02:46.35] I just knew that it would last
[03:01.35] 
[02:51.16] I want to be right where you are
[02:58.21] I want to be right where you are
[03:05.35] I want to be right where you are
[03:12.55] I want to be right where you are
[03:28.55] 
[03:18.93] I want to be right where you are (touch)
[03:21.68] (The heavens and the skies alight)
[03:26.34] I want to be right where you are (breathe)
[03:28.69] (The entire universe shines bright)
[03:46.19] 
[03:33.52] I want to be right where you are
[03:40.74] I want to be right where you are
